I can promise there are no issues, you can opt to look at a preview on

instead

# Motivation

This was created for two main reasons, one was mostly for my own reference 
as I prefer writing down notes in a teaching style to help with my training
for the Competition. The second reason was to assist me in helping to teach
the next generation of competitors for Worldskills, as I was assisting with 
that as well.
