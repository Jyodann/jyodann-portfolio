NijiGuessSaki is a project that was inspired by 
[Heardle](https://heardlegame.co/), a game that lets you guess the full song
based on a snippet of the song. Similar to the game [Wordle](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html)
but with Music üéµ.

NijiGuessSaki allows you to add a Public Spotify Playlist, and works with any song that has Song Previews:

In the guessing interface, it plays a short snippet of the song (0.5 seconds)
in a random section of the song. You may choose to add more time to play the song
to aid your guess.

# Motivation

Heardle's implementation is based on a set list of popular 
English Pop songs, but I decided to build NijiGuessSaki as a way to customise the 
songs that are in the playlist. The name "NijiGuessSaki" comes from the 
[Nijigasaki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Love_Live!_Nijigasaki_High_School_Idol_Club)
idol group from the LoveLive! series. The name was choosen as I really liked
their songs and was sharing the experience with my friend, Leonard, who
was also a Beta tester and the creator of the name as well :D
