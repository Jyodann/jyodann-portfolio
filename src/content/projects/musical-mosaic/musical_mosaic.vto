Musical Mosaic is a Web Application written with SvelteKit that produces a 
 photo collage of all your favourite songs on Spotify, inspired by [Reciptify](https://receiptify.herokuapp.com/)

<div class="flex justify-center p-2">
  <img class="h-full" src="mosaic.png"> 
</div>

It allows you to choose between time periods, blending your recent favourites,
or your all time favourites, using the Spotify's 
[Top Items API endpoint](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference/get-users-top-artists-and-tracks)


# Motivation 

At the time, there was a large number of web applications floating around
that used data to produce something unique to the user. Be it a Pie Chart,
Mood Graph, or even a Receipt. I saw that people loved to share these unique
experiences on Social Media, and decided to build one of my own. 

If you like what you see, why not give it a [whirl](https://mosaic.jyodann.com/)? ðŸ˜„
