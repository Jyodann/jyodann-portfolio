Runaway Survivor is a game that takes after the popular infinite runner, [Subway Surfers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subway_Surfers).
This project was made for a Game Modelling class in Year 2, and the models are all original, except for the humans.

The models were done in [AutoDesk Maya](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autodesk_Maya), and the task was to create
5 environmental objects (in 800 Triangles) and 5 items (in 400 Triangles). There was also a requirement to
fit and research a theme, in which I chose Post-apocalyptic.

The following items were modelled, you may view them [on Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vg6SNrwAW7y5qdpt2BchUdtBgMTJfSA9/view?usp=drive_link):
- First Aid Kit
- Crowbar
- Torch 
- Bottle
- Knife

The following environmental objects were modelled, you may view them [on Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/17q0VqILi3JhRPjBJdK3WJpDC4a7-YblG/view?usp=drive_link):
- Tree
- Lamp
- Railroad Crossing
- Building
- Train
