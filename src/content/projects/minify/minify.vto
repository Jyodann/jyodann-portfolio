Minify is a Miniplayer made for the [Spotify player](https://open.spotify.com/) 
  using the Unity Engine, built for Windows only.

The application's purpose is simple, showing what is currently playing on Spotify
in a nice Miniplayer with the following features:
- Live Syncing with currently playing song on Spotify, regardless of device that 
  is playing it
- Allows for Resume/Play/Forward/Previous playback of music
- Has a "Pin to top" feature to show above every window.

Due to issues with Windowing and Borderless Functionality, development efforts
were shifted towards using a new engine to power the Miniplayer, you can
check it out [on Bittify's page](/projects/bittify).

# Motivation

I always liked the Miniplayer Feature on Apple Music, as seen below:

</div>

But I didn't really like anything else about Apple Music, so I decided to build 
one for Spotify, and it was a really fun side project to work on while
I trained for the Worldskills Competition.

It was also the first time I had to write documentation to seek approval for API
use, and it was a pretty humbling experience to get your app rejected twice before
acceptance. ðŸ˜… You can check out the documentation
