InvestSight is a conceptual web platform made for the [2020 PolyFinTech100 API Hackathon](https://www.polyfintech100hackathon.sg/) 
that aims to generate succinct analyses of earnings call transcripts from corporations on the US stock market. 


This project was helmed by a group of 6 people, also named Team AGILE:
- Krystal (Team Lead / Presenter) 
- Ethan (UX/UI + Presentation Designer)
- Dylan (Research / Concept Design)
- Yun Lin (UX/UI Concept Designer)
- Evan (Data analyst / Research)
- Jordan Khong (me) (Programming / Research)

The project was planned to have this workflow:

- Gather Raw Data from Earning Call Transcripts 
- Clean Data 
- Use of TF-IDF (term frequencyâ€“inverse document frequency) to extract word importance 
- Use a MonkeyLearn API to determine Sentiment
- Calculation of Sentiment using Custom Formula 
- Show a dashboard of good / bad sentiment breakdown and comparisions to previous quarter scores from the same 
company
