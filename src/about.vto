    Hi there, I'm Jordan Khong, a software and game developer from Singapore.
    I enjoy creating small tools that entertain and sometimes help people;
    I primarily use Godot and Unity with C# as my go-to tools and language,
    but I am open to using various technologies to explore outside of game development.

    I graduated from Temasek Polytechnic in 2022 with a diploma in
    [Game Design and
    Development.](https://www.tp.edu.sg/schools-and-courses/students/schools/iit/immersive-media-and-game-development.html)
    (that's the old name, it changed when I graduated). During my time there, I
    had the privilege to represent my school and country in a coding competition
    named [Worldskills](https://worldskills.org/) in the IT Software Solutions
    for business skillset. I was also a part time teaching assistant for
    that skillset as well.

    In my free time, I enjoy playing games, learning languages and watching YouTube.
    Some of my favourite games are: [Super Mario Galaxy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Mario_Galaxy),
    the Resident Evil Series, particularily [Resident Evil 4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resident_Evil_4),
    and [Chunithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chunithm). I watch YouTube for
    entertainment, and to keep up to date with tech from those tech YouTubers like
    [theprimeagen](https://www.youtube.com/c/theprimeagen) and [FireShip](https://www.youtube.com/c/fireship).
    Finally, I am learning Japanese and Cantonese whenever possible.
