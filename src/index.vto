                    Hi there, I'm Jordan Khong, a software and game developer from Singapore.
                    I enjoy creating small tools that entertain and sometimes help people;
                    I primarily use Godot and Unity with C# as my go-to tools and language,
                    but I am open to using various technologies to explore outside of game development.

                    I graduated from Temasek Polytechnic in 2022 with a diploma in
                    [Game Design and
                    Development.](https://www.tp.edu.sg/schools-and-courses/students/schools/iit/immersive-media-and-game-development.html)
                    (that's the old name, it changed when I graduated). During my time there, I
                    had the privilege to represent my school and country in a coding competition
                    named [Worldskills](https://worldskills.org/) in the IT Software Solutions
                    for business skillset. I was also a part time teaching assistant for
                    that skillset as well.

                    In my free time, I enjoy playing games, learning languages and watching YouTube.
                    Some of my favourite games are: [Super Mario
                    Galaxy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Mario_Galaxy),
                    the Resident Evil Series, particularily [Resident Evil
                    4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resident_Evil_4),
                    and [Chunithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chunithm). I watch YouTube for
                    entertainment, and to keep up to date with tech from those tech YouTubers like
                    [theprimeagen](https://www.youtube.com/c/theprimeagen) and
                    [FireShip](https://www.youtube.com/c/fireship).
                    Finally, I am learning Japanese and Cantonese whenever possible.

                I would be more than happy to answer questions or discuss further opportunities! Feel free to drop me a
